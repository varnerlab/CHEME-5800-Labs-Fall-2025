    "# Activity: Estimating Single Index Models (SIMs) from Historical Data\n",
    "In this activity, students will learn how to estimate single index models from historical data. Single index models are widely used in finance to model the returns of assets based on their relationship with a market index.\n",

    "> __Learning Objectives:__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> By the end of this activity, you will be able to:\n",
    "> * **Compute continuously compounded growth rates from historical price data** - We will transform daily S&P500 stock price data into growth rate matrices and learn how to structure financial time series data for econometric analysis, gaining practical experience with real market data spanning multiple years.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Estimate single index model parameters using ordinary least squares** - We will formulate and solve the linear regression problem to estimate alpha (firm-specific return) and beta (market sensitivity) parameters for individual stocks, learning how to set up data matrices and apply closed-form solutions for parameter estimation.\n",
    ">\n",

    "## Background\n",
    "Single index models are factor models that consider only the return (growth) of the market factor. These models were originaly developed by Sharpe, 1963: [Sharpe, William F. (1963). \"A Simplified Model for Portfolio Analysis\". Management Science, 9(2): 277-293. doi:10.1287/mnsc.9.2.277.](https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/mnsc.9.2.277)\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the growth of firm $i$ at time $t$ is denoted by $\\mu^{(t)}_{i}$. Then, the single index model of the return (growth rate) is given by:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\mu^{(t)}_{i} = \\alpha_{i} + \\beta_{i}\\;\\mu^{(t)}_{M} + \\epsilon^{(t)}_{i},\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $\\alpha_{i}$ is the _idosyncratic (firm-specific) growth_, $\\beta_{i}$ is the component of the growth rate of firm $i$ explained by the market (it is also a measure of risk), and $\\epsilon^{(t)}_{i}$ denotes an error model associated with firm $i$ (describes growth rate not captured by the firm or market factors). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Parameters\n",
    "The parameters of the single index model have some interesting interpretations.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The $\\alpha_{i}$ parameter is the idiosyncratic (firm-specific) growth, which captures the growth rate of firm $i$ that is __not__ explained by the market index. \n",
    "* The $\\beta_{i}$ parameter has two meanings: it is a measure of the the growth rate of firm $i$ explained by the market index, and it is also a measure of risk. A higher $\\beta_{i}$ indicates that the growth rate of firm $i$ is more sensitive to changes in the market index, and thus, it is more risky. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dig into the meaning of the $\\beta_{i}$ parameter a little more, starting with the growth interpretation. We can rearrance the SIM as:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\mu^{(t)}_{i} &= \\alpha_{i} + \\beta_{i}\\;\\mu^{(t)}_{M} + \\epsilon^{(t)}_{i}\\\\\n",
    "\\mu^{(t)}_{i} - \\alpha_{i} - \\epsilon^{(t)}_{i} &= \\beta_{i}\\;\\mu^{(t)}_{M}\\\\\n",
    "\\underbrace{\\frac{\\mu^{(t)}_{i} - \\alpha_{i} - \\epsilon^{(t)}_{i}}{\\mu^{(t)}_{M}}}_{\\text{fraction explained by market}} &= \\beta_{i}\\quad\\blacksquare\\\\\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "The risk interpretation of $\\beta$ is a more subtle. To understand this, let's start by taking the variance of both sides of the SIM:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\text{Var}\\left(\\mu^{(t)}_{i}\\right) &= \\text{Var}\\left(\\alpha_{i} + \\beta_{i}\\;\\mu^{(t)}_{M} + \\epsilon^{(t)}_{i}\\right)\\\\\n",
    "&= \\text{Var}\\left(\\alpha_{i}\\right) + \\text{Var}\\left(\\beta_{i}\\;\\mu^{(t)}_{M}\\right) + \\text{Var}\\left(\\epsilon^{(t)}_{i}\\right)\\\\\n",
    "&= 0 + \\beta_{i}^{2}\\;\\text{Var}\\left(\\mu^{(t)}_{M}\\right) + \\text{Var}\\left(\\epsilon^{(t)}_{i}\\right)\\\\\n",
    "\\sigma_{i}^{2} &= \\beta_{i}^{2}\\;\\sigma_{M}^{2} + \\sigma_{\\epsilon,i}^{2}\\quad\\blacksquare\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where we used the fact that $\\alpha_{i}$ is a constant (variance is zero), $\\beta_{i}$ is a constant that can be factored out of the variance, and we assume that the error term $\\epsilon^{(t)}_{i}$ is uncorrelated with the market growth $\\mu^{(t)}_{M}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "> __Risk__: The total risk of firm $i$ (measured by $\\sigma_{i}^{2}$) consists of two components:  __Systematic risk__: $\\beta_{i}^{2}\\;\\sigma_{M}^{2}$ and __Idiosyncratic risk__: $\\sigma_{\\epsilon,i}^{2}$.\n",
    "> The systematic risk is the risk that comes from exposure to market movements, while the idiosyncratic risk is the firm-specific risk that is independent of the market.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to derive the formula for $\\beta_{i}$, we need to use the covariance relationship. Taking the covariance of both sides of the SIM with the market growth $\\mu^{(t)}_{M}$:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "\\text{Cov}\\left(\\mu^{(t)}_{i}, \\mu^{(t)}_{M}\\right) &= \\text{Cov}\\left(\\alpha_{i} + \\beta_{i}\\;\\mu^{(t)}_{M} + \\epsilon^{(t)}_{i}, \\mu^{(t)}_{M}\\right)\\\\\n",
    "&= \\text{Cov}\\left(\\alpha_{i}, \\mu^{(t)}_{M}\\right) + \\text{Cov}\\left(\\beta_{i}\\;\\mu^{(t)}_{M}, \\mu^{(t)}_{M}\\right) + \\text{Cov}\\left(\\epsilon^{(t)}_{i}, \\mu^{(t)}_{M}\\right)\\\\\n",
    "&= 0 + \\beta_{i}\\;\\text{Cov}\\left(\\mu^{(t)}_{M}, \\mu^{(t)}_{M}\\right) + 0\\\\\n",
    "&= \\beta_{i}\\;\\text{Var}\\left(\\mu^{(t)}_{M}\\right)\\\\\n",
    "\\text{Cov}\\left(\\mu^{(t)}_{i}, \\mu^{(t)}_{M}\\right) &= \\beta_{i}\\;\\sigma_{M}^{2}\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\text{solve for }\\beta_{i}\\\\\n",
    "\\beta_{i} &= \\frac{\\text{Cov}\\left(\\mu^{(t)}_{i}, \\mu^{(t)}_{M}\\right)}{\\text{Var}\\left(\\mu^{(t)}_{M}\\right)} = \\frac{\\text{Cov}\\left(\\mu_{i}, \\mu_{M}\\right)}{\\text{Var}\\left(\\mu_{M}\\right)}\\quad\\blacksquare\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Beta:__\n",
    "> The $\\beta_{i}$ parameter measures how much systematic risk the firm carries relative to the market. \n",
    "> * If $\\beta_{i} = 1$, the firm moves in lockstep with the market. \n",
    "> * If $\\beta_{i} > 1$, the firm is more volatile than the market (amplifies market movements). \n",
    "> * If $\\beta_{i} < 1$, the firm is less volatile than the market (dampens market movements).\n",
