However, given the same starting node and graph structure, the two algorithms may produce the same path in certain cases, particularly in simple or linear graphs. Thus, both approaches will also always visit the same set of reachable nodes, ensuring that all reachable nodes are explored, albeit in a different order.\n",

    "__So why do we care about the differences between DFS and BFS?__ These traversal algorithms are foundational in the sense that we build things from them. They have different use cases and performance characteristics. DFS is often more memory-efficient, while BFS is better suited for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs, as it explores all neighbors at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.\n",
    "\n",
    "__DFS versus BFS__? Choose DFS for deep structure exploration (cycle detection, topological sorting) or when memory is limited in tree-like graphs, as it uses $O(h)$ space versus BFS's $O(b)$ space where $h$ is depth and $b$ is maximum nodes per level. Choose BFS when you need shortest paths in unweighted graphs or when targets are likely close to the starting node."
