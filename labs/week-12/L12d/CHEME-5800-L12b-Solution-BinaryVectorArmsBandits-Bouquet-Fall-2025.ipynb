    "## Summary\n",
    "In this activity, we applied a binary vector arms bandit algorithm to solve the Bouquet Design Problem with stochastic market pricing, demonstrating how combinatorial optimization can be tackled through adaptive exploration of discrete choice combinations under uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. **Binary vector arms for combinatorial problems**: We represented bouquet compositions as binary vectors where each element indicates inclusion or exclusion of a flower type, showing how bandit algorithms can efficiently explore exponentially large action spaces (2^K possible combinations) without exhaustive enumeration.\n",
    "> 2. **Context-aware utility optimization under uncertainty**: We separated the problem structure (base prices, preferences, budget constraints) in the context model from the stochastic market observations encountered during arm evaluation. The `customer(...)` function observes market prices with ±15% random fluctuations around base prices, demonstrating how domain knowledge and constraints guide the exploration-exploitation tradeoff toward feasible and desirable solutions even when market conditions are volatile.\n",
    "> 3. **Adaptive allocation with preference learning**: The epsilon-greedy algorithm learned to allocate budget optimally across flower types by balancing exploration of uncertain combinations with exploitation of high-utility bouquets, handling both positive and negative preferences while respecting quantity bounds and budget constraints. By averaging rewards across multiple stochastic price observations, the algorithm converged to robust bouquet compositions that perform well despite market volatility.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach provides a practical framework for sequential decision-making in combinatorial optimization problems where preferences and constraints are known, but prices and utilities must be learned through repeated interaction with stochastic market environments."
