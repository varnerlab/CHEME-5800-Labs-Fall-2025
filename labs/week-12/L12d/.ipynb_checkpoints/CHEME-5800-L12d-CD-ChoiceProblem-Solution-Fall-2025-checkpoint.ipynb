    "# Maximum Utility Bouquet Optimization Problem\n",
    "Suppose you have a collection of flower types that can be included in a bouquet, denoted by $\\mathcal{F}$.\n",
    "The goal is to allocate a fixed budget $B$ across these flowers to **maximize the utility** of the bouquet, where utility is determined by quantitative consumer‑preference measures.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Utility Function:__ A utility function $U:\\mathbb{R}_{+}^{F}\\to\\mathbb{R}$ maps the number of stems of each flower in the bouquet to a real‑valued utility score that reflects the consumer's satisfaction with that arrangement. We use a Cobb‑Douglas utility function to model consumer preferences:\n",
    "> $$\n",
    "\\begin{align*}\n",
    "U\\left(n_{1},n_{2},\\dots,n_{F}\\right) = \\kappa(\\gamma)\\prod_{i\\in\\mathcal{F}}n_{i}^{\\gamma_{i}}\n",
    "\\end{align*}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "> where $\\gamma_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}$ is the **preference coefficient** for flower $i$ (to be estimated), and $\\kappa(\\gamma)$ is a leading coefficient that sets the scale of the utility function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $n_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}_{+}$ denote the **number of stems** of flower $i$ in the bouquet (to be estimated).\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Inclusion:__ Not every flower type is included in the **final** bouquet. Inclusion (or exclusion) of a flower type is governed by a binary action vector $\\mathbf{a}$, where $a_{j}=1$ if flower $j$ is included in the bouquet and $a_{j}=0$ otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "A budget $B$ is allocated across the flowers, where $p_{i}$ denotes the price per stem of flower $i$ at the time of allocation. The optimal bouquet is the solution of the utility‑maximization problem:\n",

    "We assume that the budget $B$ is fixed over the planning horizon and that the prices $p_{i}$ are constant during allocation (bounded by typical market variations). Fractional stems are allowed. Short selling does not apply.\n",

    "The leading coefficient $\\kappa(\\gamma)$ sets the scale of the utility function. Because utility is ordinal, we may set its scale arbitrarily; for example, choose $\\kappa = 1$ when all $\\gamma_{i}$ are positive and $\\kappa = -1$ if any $\\gamma_{i}$ is negative.\n",

    "#### Analytical Solution\n",
    "The stem‑optimization problem admits an **analytical solution**. Let $S = \\{i \\mid a_{i}=1\\}$ denote the set of selected flower types; $S_{+} = \\{i \\mid \\gamma_{i}>0\\}$ the preferred flowers; and $S_{-} = \\{i \\mid \\gamma_{i}<0\\}$ the non‑preferred flowers. The optimal maximum‑utility bouquet given the action $\\mathbf{a}$, the budget $B$, consumer preferences $\\gamma_{i}$, and the price per stem $p_{i}$ of flower $i$ is\n",

    "#### Consumer Preference Model\n",
    "The $\\gamma_{i}$ coefficients reflect the relative importance of each flower in generating utility for the consumer. These coefficients can incorporate market conditions, seasonal trends, and other flower‑specific information through an $m$‑dimensional feature vector $\\mathbf{x}_{i}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{m}$:\n",
