    "# L2b: Fun With Base 16 Numbers\n",
    "As scientists and engineers, we often encounter situations where the most critical numbering systems for data science and machine learning applications are not floating-point numbers, but rather base-$b$ integers. This might seem surprising, but it's true!\n",
    "\n",
    "Base-$b$ integers are used in many often overlooked but critical applications. In this lab, we'll explore one such application: the mathematical encoding of text.\n",
    "* __Backstory__: Computers don't see text the way humans do—as collections of strings, emojis, and punctuation. Instead, computers process text as sequences of binary bits. Each character in text must be mapped to a unique integer (a sequence of binary bits). Since it's difficult for humans to work with long binary sequences, we express these integers using positional notation in various bases, making text just another type of numerical sequence.\n",
    "* __Why base $b$?__ Aren't base-10 numbers sufficient? While base-10 works, Unicode code points can be up to 4 bytes (32 bits) long. Working with 32-digit binary numbers is cumbersome, so we use other bases like hexadecimal (base 16) to create more compact, human-readable representations that can still be efficiently decoded back into the original characters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start at the beginning.\n",
    "* Traditionally, characters were represented using [the ASCII system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII). [Standard (7-bit) ASCII](https://www.ascii-code.com/ASCII) uses 7 bits of storage and defines 128 character codes numbered 0 through 127 (each character is mapped to a number ranging from 0 to 127). [Extended (8-bit) ASCII variants](https://www.ascii-code.com) use 8 bits and define 256 values numbered 0 to 255. But is 255 characters enough?\n",
    "* No! Modern encodings, such as [Unicode encodings like UTF-8 or UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode), represent a much wider range of characters and symbols.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, we'll explore the numerical basis of text, starting with the [7-bit ASCII system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII) and progressing to [Unicode encodings like UTF-8 or UTF-16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode). \n",

    "Let's start by considering the representation of the characters in the 7-bit ASCII character system. \n",

    "* __Fun fact__: While 7-bit ASCII has been replaced a long time ago, it still lives on in the modern [Unicode system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode). The original ASCII characters are encoded as the first 128 characters (`0`$\\rightarrow$`127`) in [the Unicode system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode).\n",

    "### Limitations of ASCII\n",
    "Wow! ASCII seems pretty cool. It only uses 7 bits (which is super simple) to encode 128 characters (numbers, small and capital letters, some math symbols, etc). Why would we ever need anything beyond these 127 characters? As it turns out, there are many reasons. Let's look at three:\n",
    "* The original 7-bit ASCII was limited to 128 characters (0–127), so it couldn’t represent characters beyond basic English letters, digits, punctuation, and control codes.\n",
    "* The original 7-bit ASCII character set offered no native support for accented or non-Latin characters (e.g., Cyrillic, Greek, and Arabic), hindering internationalization. It only represented English.\n",
    "* The original 7-bit ASCII character set omitted modern typographic symbols, mathematical glyphs, and emojis, making it inadequate for rich text or graphical communication. For example, it can't be used to represent rich mathematical text. Bummer!\n",

    "## Task 2: Explore the Unicode Character Set\n",
    "Unlike the original 7-bit ASCII character set, which has only 128 characters, the modern [Unicode system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) _can encode_ 1,114,112 possible characters (code points). However, as of [Unicode Standard version 16.0 (released September 10, 2024)](https://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode16.0.0/), only 154,998 of those possible code points are assigned to unique characters; various characters in many languages, a much larger family of mathematical symbols, and [emoji](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoji) of all sorts are currently assigned. There is plenty of room to grow!\n",
    "\n",
    "Technical:\n",
    "* The [Unicode system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode) uses up to 4 bytes (32 bits) of storage per character, and indexes characters using a base $b =16$ (hexadecimal) numbering system. Hexadecimal numbers are used as a convenience; they are much shorter than their binary equivalents and, thus, are easier for us to read and write than long sequences of 0s and 1s. While Unicode code points are ultimately stored as binary values, hexadecimal provides a direct and convenient way for us (humans) to represent these values.\n",
    "* Julia has [built-in Unicode support in the standard library](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/stdlib/Unicode/#Unicode); thus, we can work with these characters in our programs.
