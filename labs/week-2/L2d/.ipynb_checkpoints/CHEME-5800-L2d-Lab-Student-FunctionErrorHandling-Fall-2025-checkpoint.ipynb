    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "__Congratulations!__ You have successfully completed the error handling and debugging lab. In this activity, you learned several important concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Learning Outcomes:\n",
    "1. **Robust Factory Methods**: How to implement factory methods with comprehensive error checking that validate input parameters before object construction\n",
    "2. **Error vs. Warning Handling**: The difference between throwing errors (which stop execution) and issuing warnings (which allow execution to continue with default values)\n",
    "3. **Assertion Testing**: How to use the `@assert` macro to validate object state and ensure your code behaves as expected\n",
    "4. **Graceful Error Recovery**: Best practices for handling invalid inputs by returning meaningful error messages and `nothing` values rather than allowing the program to crash\n",
    "5. **Progressive Error Handling**: How to implement layered error checking that catches different types of problems at different stages\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Practices Demonstrated:\n",
    "- Always validate input parameters in factory/constructor methods\n",
    "- Use descriptive error messages that help users understand what went wrong\n",
    "- Test both \"happy path\" scenarios and error conditions\n",
    "- Use assertions to validate that objects are in expected states\n",
    "- Design error handling that provides useful feedback rather than cryptic failures\n",
    "\n",
    "These skills will be essential as you develop more complex Julia applications where robust error handling can make the difference between a program that crashes unexpectedly and one that provides helpful feedback to users when things go wrong.\n",
