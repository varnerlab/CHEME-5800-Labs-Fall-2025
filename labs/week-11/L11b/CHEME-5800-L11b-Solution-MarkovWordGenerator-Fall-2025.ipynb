    "> * **Implement stochastic word generation using Markov chains:** We apply the transition matrix to generate random words by starting with an initial character and iteratively sampling subsequent characters according to learned transition probabilities, producing character sequences of specified length.\n",

    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * **Statistical learning from corpus data:** We built a 26×26 character transition matrix by analyzing patterns in 370K English words, demonstrating how Markov models can capture the statistical structure of language through observed character co-occurrence frequencies in real linguistic data.\n",
    "> * **Stochastic sequence generation algorithm:** We implemented a forward sampling approach that starts with an initial character and iteratively selects subsequent characters by sampling from categorical distributions defined by the transition matrix, producing random yet statistically plausible character sequences.\n",
    "> * **Empirical validation of generative models:** We verified that a measurable fraction of randomly generated sequences matched actual English words in the vocabulary, illustrating how simple probabilistic models can approximate complex linguistic patterns while also revealing limitations through the presence of non-word sequences.\n",

    "This Markov word generator demonstrates fundamental principles of statistical language modeling, with natural extensions to higher-order models (bigrams, trigrams) and applications in text generation, spell correction, and computational linguistics.\n",
