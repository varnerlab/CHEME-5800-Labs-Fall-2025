    "## L11d: Value Iteration for Grid World Navigation\n",
    "In this lab, you will implement the value iteration algorithm to solve a two-dimensional grid world navigation task where a robot must find the optimal path from any starting position to a charging station while avoiding lava pits. However, like everything in life, there is a backstory.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Backstory:__ We have a value iteration algorithm that we took from [the Algorithms for Decision Making book](https://algorithmsbook.com/decisionmaking/), which is written by some folks at Stanford University. However, the code is convoluted and hard to follow (we've included it here). Your task is to refactor the value iteration code into a simpler version that is easier to understand and closer to the pseudocode that we discussed in lecture (with a convergence check, clear Bellman update step, etc.). Once you have your refactored version working, you will compare the results to ensure that your implementation produces the same optimal value function as the original.\n",

    "\n",
    "> __Learning Objectives:__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> After completing this activity, students will be able to:\n",
    "> * **Construct Markov Decision Process (MDP) models for spatial navigation:** We build a 20×20 grid world MDP with states representing grid positions, actions for movement (left, right, up, down), rewards for reaching goals or hazards, and transition dynamics encoding deterministic movement.\n",
    "> * **Implement value iteration with Bellman updates:** We iteratively compute the optimal value function $U^*(s)$ using the Bellman backup operation, which propagates utility values backward from high-reward states until convergence, enabling optimal decision-making from any state.\n",
    "> * **Extract optimal policies from value functions:** We derive the optimal policy $\\pi^*(s)$ by computing the action-value function $Q(s,a)$ from the converged value function and selecting the action that maximizes expected future reward at each state, then visualize the resulting navigation paths.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how value iteration solves sequential decision problems by computing optimal policies that balance immediate rewards with long-term consequences. Let's get started!\n",

    "## Discussion: Extensions and Open Questions\n",
    "Now that we have a working value iteration implementation, there are many interesting directions to explore that would deepen our understanding of MDPs and reinforcement learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Future Directions:__\n",
    "> 1. **Impact of discount factor:** How does changing $\\gamma$ affect the optimal policy? Try values like $\\gamma = 0.5$ (myopic, prioritizes immediate rewards) versus $\\gamma = 0.99$ (far-sighted, values long-term rewards). Do paths change? Does the robot take different routes?\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 2. **Stochastic transitions:** Our current model has deterministic transitions where actions always succeed. What if we introduced uncertainty? For example, when the robot tries to move up, it could succeed 80% of the time but accidentally move left/right 10% each. How would this affect the optimal policy and path safety margins around lava pits?\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 3. **Convergence speed:** How many iterations does value iteration require to converge for different grid sizes? Try 5×5, 10×10, and 40×40 grids. How does the number of iterations scale with state space size? What about different tolerance values $\\epsilon$?\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 4. **Multiple goals:** What happens if we add multiple charging stations at different locations with different rewards? Does the robot always choose the closest one, or does the path efficiency trade-off matter?\n",
    "> \n",
    "> 5. **Continuous state spaces:** Our grid is discrete, but real robots operate in continuous space. How would you extend this approach to handle continuous positions and orientations? (Hint: look into function approximation and deep reinforcement learning)\n",

    "## Summary\n",
    "In this example, we implemented the value iteration algorithm to solve a 20×20 grid world navigation task, computing the optimal policy for a robot to reach a charging station while avoiding lava pits from any starting position.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    "> \n",
    "> * **MDP formulation for spatial navigation:** We constructed a Markov Decision Process with 400 states representing grid positions, 4 directional movement actions, deterministic transition dynamics, and a reward structure balancing goal achievement (+100 for charging station), hazard avoidance (-1000 for lava pits), and path efficiency (-1 step cost), all discounted to prioritize reaching the goal quickly.\n",
    "> * **Value iteration with Bellman updates:** We iteratively computed the optimal value function by applying the Bellman backup operation, which propagates utility values backward from high-reward states through the state space until convergence. This process evaluates the long-term value of every grid position by considering both immediate rewards and discounted future returns.\n",
    "> * **Policy extraction and visualization:** We derived the optimal policy by computing action-value functions from the converged value function and selecting the best action at each state. Visualizing the resulting navigation paths showed how the robot optimally navigates from arbitrary starting positions to the charging station while circumventing hazards, demonstrating that value iteration produces rational goal-directed behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "Value iteration provides a principled approach to solving sequential decision problems by computing policies that maximize expected cumulative reward, with applications in robotics, autonomous systems, and resource allocation.\n",
