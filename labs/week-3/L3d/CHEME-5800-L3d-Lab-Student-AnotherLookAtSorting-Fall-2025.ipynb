    "> __How does Bubblesort work?__ It involves repeatedly passing through the list, comparing adjacent items, and swapping any two neighboring items that are out of order. The algorithm gets its name because smaller elements \"bubble\" to the top of the list, just like how air bubbles rise to the surface of water.\n",

The algorithm then recursively sorts the sub-arrays until they have less than two elements. The choice of pivot is critical for the algorithm's efficiency.\n",
