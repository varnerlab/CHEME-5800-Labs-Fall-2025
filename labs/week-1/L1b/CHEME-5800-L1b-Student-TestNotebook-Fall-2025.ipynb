The `Include.jl` file sets paths, loads required external packages, etc. For additional information on functions and types used in this material, see the [Julia programming language documentation](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/). \n",

    "> __What is the `let` block?__ The [`let` block](https://docs.julialang.org/en/v1/base/base/#let) creates a new hard scope and optionally introduces new local bindings. Variables introduced inside a `let` block are local to that block and don't affect variables of the same name in the outer scope. In our case, the `let` block allows us to create local variables (`number_of_samples` and the local `samples`) that are only visible within the block, while the final value of `samples` is returned and assigned to the global variable `samples`. This is a common Julia pattern for organizing code and avoiding namespace pollution.\n",
