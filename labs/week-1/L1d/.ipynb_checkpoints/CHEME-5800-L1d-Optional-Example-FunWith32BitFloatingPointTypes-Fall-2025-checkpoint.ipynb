    "> __Why do we care?__ The `Float32` type offers a sweet spot for deep learning: its 24‐bit significand (which gives seven decimal digits) and 8‐bit exponent provide sufficient precision and dynamic range for most applications, halving the memory footprint compared to `Float64`. This enables computation leveraging specialized hardware optimized specifically for 32-bit arithmetic.\n",
