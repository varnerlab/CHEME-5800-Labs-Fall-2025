    "We work with numerical data in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) all the time. But have you ever stopped to wonder how computers actually represent (and manipulate) numbers? Let's explore the secret life of common floating-point data types, how they are represented in memory, and the precision associated with each type.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Key (surprising) fact__: Integer values on computers are __exact__ representations. However, all floating-point numbers are __approximations__! A floating-point value uses a _fixed number of bits_ to store a value, so it can only represent a finite set of rational values rather than the continuum of real numbers. Thus, any real number must be rounded to the nearest floating-point value, making every floating-point value an approximation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The typical floating-point number types you will likely encounter in applications are `Float16`, `Float32`, and `Float64`. But what do these numbers mean? For example, what do the `16`, `32`, and `64` mean in `FloatXX`, what precision can these numbers describe, and how are they represented in memory?\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we'll cover:** On conventional (non-quantum) hardware, floating-point numbers are stored as binary values (base `2`). Let's start by reviewing base-`b` positional notation, then examine integer bitstrings and finally dig into floating-point formats.\n",
