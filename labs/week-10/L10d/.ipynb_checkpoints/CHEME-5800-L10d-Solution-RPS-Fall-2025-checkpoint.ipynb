    "## Background: Multiplicative Weights Algorithm (MWA)\n",
    "The **Multiplicative Weights Algorithm (MWA)** is a simple yet robust online learning method that embodies a similar idea to the weighted majority algorithm, i.e., learning from expert advice. Here, the learning rate $\\eta$ plays a role analogous to $\\varepsilon$ in the Weighted Majority Algorithm, controlling adaptation speed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s walk through the setup and sketch out the algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem Setting\n",
    "Suppose we are faced with a repeated decision-making task over rounds $t = 1, 2, \\ldots, T$. At each round, we have access to $N$ experts, each providing a recommendation or prediction. Our goal is to combine their advice adaptively in order to make strong decisions over time, even in adversarial or uncertain environments.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Let $\\mathbf{p}^{(t)} = \\{p_1^{(t)}, p_2^{(t)}, \\ldots, p_N^{(t)}\\}$ denote our belief distribution over experts at round $t$, updated iteratively based on their past performance.\n",
    "* We select an expert by sampling from this distribution—for example, using a Categorical distribution:\n",
    "  $i \\sim \\texttt{Categorical}(\\mathbf{p}^{(t)})$—and follow that expert’s recommendation.\n",
    "* After the decision is made, the environment (or adversary) reveals the true outcome. We then compute a cost vector $\\mathbf{m}^{(t)} = \\{m_1^{(t)}, \\dots, m_N^{(t)}\\}$, where $m_i^{(t)} \\in [-1, 1]$ denotes the cost incurred by expert $i$ at time $t$. A correct prediction receives a cost of $-1$, and an incorrect one receives a cost of $+1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "__Initialize__: Fix a learning rate $\\eta\\leq{1}/{2}$, for each expert initialize the weight $w_{i}^{(1)} = 1$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For $t=1,2,\\dots,T$:\n",
    "1. Chose expert $i$ with probability $p_{i}^{(t)} = w_{i}^{(t)}/\\sum_{j=1}^{N}w_{j}^{(t)}$. Ask expert $i$ what the outcome of the experiment should be, denote the experts answer to this as: $\\hat{y}_{i}^{(t)}$.\n",
    "2. The adversary (nature) reveals the true outcome $y_{t}$ of the experiment at time $t$. Compute the cost of the following expert $i$, denoted as $m_{i}^{(t)}$. \n",

    "## MWA Applied to zero-sum games\n",
    "Let's consider the application of the multiplicative weights update algorithm to zero-sum games. \n",
    "\n",
    "> In [a zero-sum game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zero-sum_game), players have _opposing interests_, and the players' payoffs sum to zero: one's gain is the other's loss. The multiplicative-weights (MW) algorithm finds (approximate) Nash equilibria by down-weighting poorly performing actions over repeated play.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's dig into some the details of the game:\n",
    "* **Game**: Consider a competitive setting with $k$ players. A game is called **zero-sum** if, for any outcome, the players' payoffs add to zero. The standard theory we use below focuses on the $k = 2$ case. Each player chooses an action $a \\in \\mathcal{A}$ from some finite action set $\\mathcal{A}$ with $|\\mathcal{A}| = N$. For the two-player case, we model payoffs with a matrix $\\mathbf{M} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ (for simplicity, assume both players have $N$ actions). If the row player chooses action $i$ and the column player chooses action $j$, then the row player's payoff is $m_{ij}$ and the column player's payoff is $-m_{ij}$. This is what we mean by __zero-sum__: whatever one player gains, the other loses.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Goals**: The row player wants to **maximize** their payoff. The column player wants to **minimize** the row player's payoff. Let the row player randomize over rows using a mixed strategy $\\mathbf{p}$ (a probability distribution over the $N$ rows), and let the column player randomize over columns using a mixed strategy $\\mathbf{q}$ (a probability distribution over the $N$ columns). The expected payoff to the row player is $\\mathbf{p}^{\\top}\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{q}$ and because the game is zero-sum, the expected payoff to the column player is $-\\mathbf{p}^{\\top}\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{q}$. So both players care about the same scalar $\\mathbf{p}^{\\top}\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{q}$, but they pull it in opposite directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Nash Equilibrium**: A Nash equilibrium is a pair of (possibly mixed) strategies $(\\mathbf{p}^*, \\mathbf{q}^*)$ such that each player's strategy is a best response to the other's. In other words, given $\\mathbf{q}^*$, the row player cannot switch from $\\mathbf{p}^*$ to some other $\\mathbf{p}$ and improve their expected payoff, and given $\\mathbf{p}^*$, the column player cannot switch from $\\mathbf{q}^*$ to some other $\\mathbf{q}$ and further reduce the row player's expected payoff.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a two-player zero-sum game, every Nash equilibrium corresponds to a **minimax solution**. The minimax theorem guarantees that:\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\max_{\\mathbf{p}} \\min_{\\mathbf{q}} \\mathbf{p}^{\\top}\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{q} = \\min_{\\mathbf{q}} \\max_{\\mathbf{p}} \\mathbf{p}^{\\top}\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{q} = v\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $v$ is called the value of the game. At equilibrium, the row player's strategy $\\mathbf{p}^*$ guarantees at least $v$ no matter what the column player does, and the column player's strategy $\\mathbf{q}^*$ holds the row player to at most $v$ no matter what the row player does. That shared value $v$ is the Nash equilibrium payoff.\n",
    "  \n",
    "Finally, learning dynamics: if both players repeatedly play the game and update their mixed strategies using sublinear algorithms such as multiplicative weights, then the time-averaged strategies approach an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium (equivalently, an $\\epsilon$-minimax solution), where $\\epsilon$ becomes small as regret becomes small.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm\n",
    "Let's outline a simple implementation of the multiplicative weights update algorithm for a two-player zero-sum game. Given a payoff matrix $\\mathbf{M}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times{N}}$, we want to find a _mixed strategy_, a probability distribution over actions, for the row player that minimizes expected loss.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Initialization:__ Given a payoff matrix $\\mathbf{M}\\in\\mathbb{R}^{N\\times{N}}$, where the payoffs (elements of $\\mathbf{M}$) are in the range $m_{ij}\\in[-1, 1]$. \n",

    "\n",
    "> __Choosing T__: The number of rounds $T$ determines the accuracy of the approximate Nash equilibrium. To achieve an $\\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium, choose $T \\geq \\frac{\\ln N}{\\epsilon^2}$. For example, with $N=10$ actions and desired accuracy $\\epsilon=0.1$, we need $T \\geq \\frac{\\ln 10}{0.01} \\approx 230$ rounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "> __Choosing η__: The learning rate $\\eta$ controls the step size of weight updates. Common rules of thumb include:\n",
    "> - __Theory-based__: $\\eta = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\ln N}{T}}$ optimizes the convergence bound\n",
    "> - __Simple rule__: $\\eta = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{T}}$ for practical applications  \n",
    "> - __Adaptive__: Start with $\\eta = 0.1$ and reduce by half if convergence stalls\n",
    "> - __Constraint__: Ensure $\\eta \\leq 1$ to prevent negative weights (since losses are bounded in $[-1,1]$)\n",
    "\n",

    "1. Compute the normalization factor: $\\Phi^{(t)} \\gets \\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_{i}^{(t)}$.\n",

    "2. __Column player__ computes its strategy: The _column player_ will choose action: $j\\gets \\text{arg}\\min_{j\\in\\mathcal{A}}\\left\\{\\mathbf{p}^{(t)\\top}\\mathbf{M}\\mathbf{e}_{j}\\right\\}$, so that $\\mathbf{q}^{(t)} \\gets \\mathbf{e}_{j}$, where $\\mathbf{e}_{j}$ is the $j$-th standard basis vector. The row player experiences loss vector $\\boldsymbol{\\ell}^{(t)} \\gets \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{q}^{(t)}$, where $\\mathbf{L} = -\\mathbf{M}$ is the loss matrix.\n",

    "\n",
    "> __Key Takeaways:__\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * **Adaptive strategy updates:** The Multiplicative Weights Algorithm adjusts player strategies by updating weights based on payoffs, down-weighting poorly performing actions to encourage mixing.\n",
    "> * **Convergence to equilibrium:** Over many rounds, the average strategies approach an approximate Nash equilibrium, where neither player can gain by unilaterally changing strategy.\n",
    "> * **Application to zero-sum games:** The algorithm handles competitive settings like Rock-Paper-Scissors, converging to uniform mixing (equal probability for each action) as the optimal response to an adaptive opponent.\n",

    "The Multiplicative Weights Algorithm effectively finds balanced strategies in zero-sum games without prior knowledge of the opponent's moves.\n",
